    "# Identifying Need for Change: North Carolina School Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the 2,617 public schools (including Charter) operating in North Carolina during the 2016-2017 school year, 902 schools (34.5%) have, for at least one year since 2013-2014, been classified as a low performing school. \n",
    "\n",
    "NCPDI classifies low performing schools as:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Low-performing schools are those that receive a **school performance grade** of **D** or **F** and a **school growth score** of **\"met expected growth\"** or **\"not met expected growth\"** as defined by G.S. 115C-83.15.” (G.S. 115C-105.37(a)), and\n",
    "\n",
    "“A Low-performing local school administrative unit is a unit in which the majority of the schools in that unit that received a school performance grade and school growth score as provided in G.S. 115C-83.15 have been identified as low-performing schools, as provided in G.S. 115C-105.37.” (G.S. 115C-105.39A(a)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: http://www.ncpublicschools.org/schooltransformation/low-performing/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thus, we treat low performing schools as a proxy for aggregate student educational achievement.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement: \n",
    "In recent years, 30% of public schools in North Carolina have been low performing. Students in low performing schools are not meeting the educational achievement standards set by the state. Factors outside administrators' control: economically disadvantaged and majority-minority student populations, are the most influential indicators of low performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation: \n",
    "Of the 902 schools low performing between 2013/14 and 2016/17, 209 have been low performing for all schools years (8%), 203 have been low performing for 3 of the schools years (7.8%), 227 have been low performing for 2 schools years (8.7%), and 263 have been low performing once (10%). Another way to look at these numbers is to consider that out of the four school years between 2013/14 and 2016/2017, 24.4% of schools have been recurringly low performing. \n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean in terms of students? \n",
    "Out of around the 1.5 million total number of students studying in a public school in the 2016/17 school year, around 460,000 of those students (30%) have had at least a year studying a low performing school. Around 100,000 students (6.8%) in North Carolina study at a school that has been low performing for 4 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution:\n",
    "We identify the factors within school administrator's control that can positively impact a school's EVAAS growth score. Growth scores are a metric to measure how well a school's performance increases over a year. We focus on growth instead of raw performance scores, as raw scores will be much slower to change over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reviews NCPDI North Carolina School Report Card and Statistical Profile data to identify the factors that contribute to low school performance and EVAAS growth scores. We will then create a model to predict EVAAS growth scores including only school-level factors irrespective of student demographics. After determining the most predictive factors for determining EVAAS growth scores, we simulate changes in these factors to demonstrate a theoretical improvement in student achievement growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "We: \n",
    "1. Take a look at the heuristically most common reasons for low school performance: percentage of economically disadvantaged students, student demographics, and school funding to see if these indicators are statistically different in low performing schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remove the factors outside of the school adminsitration's control from the dataset to determine which school-level factors are most important in determining low performance by:\n",
    "    1. Performing Feature Importance using XGBoost. XGBoost is a tree-based gradient-boosting method which minimizes a cost function relative to predicting a target variable. When a node in a decision tree is split, we can calculate the following reduction in impurity, and attribute this reduction to feature involved. When the tree is finished splitting nodes, those features with the largest proportional contribution toward decreasing impurity within nodes can be said to be the most “important.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Test the predictive nature of our selected features by creating a classification model to predict the EVAAS growth score for each of our 4 years. Whether these features are important will be reflected in the accuracy and precision of the regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use a new methodology for decision-making. We create a function that will synthesize data based on percent changes in a certain input feature to then be used in our regression model to predict low performance. This will allow us to review, all things being equal, how a change in one or more features may correlate to a change in school EVAAS growth score. \n",
