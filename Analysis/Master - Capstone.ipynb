    "## Identifying Need for Change: North Carolina School Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the 2,617 public schools (including Charter) operating in North Carolina during the 2016-2017 school year, 902 schools (34.5%) have, for at least one year since 2013-2014, been classified as a low performing school. \n",
    "\n",
    "NCPDI classifies low performing schools as:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Low-performing schools are those that receive a **school performance grade** of **D** or **F** and a **school growth score** of **\"met expected growth\"** or **\"not met expected growth\"** as defined by G.S. 115C-83.15.” (G.S. 115C-105.37(a)), and\n",
    "\n",
    "“A Low-performing local school administrative unit is a unit in which the majority of the schools in that unit that received a school performance grade and school growth score as provided in G.S. 115C-83.15 have been identified as low-performing schools, as provided in G.S. 115C-105.37.” (G.S. 115C-105.39A(a)).\n",

    "Of the 902 schools low performing between 2013/14 and 2016/17, 209 have been low performing for all schools years (8%), 203 have been low performing for 3 of the schools years (7.8%), 227 have been low performing for 2 schools years (8.7%), and 263 have been low performing once (10%). Another way to look at these numbers is to consider that out of the four school years between 2013/14 and 2016/2017, 24.4% of schools have been recurringly low performing. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reviews NCPDI North Carolina School Report Card and Statistical Profile data to identify the factors that contribute to low school performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "We: \n",
    "1. Take a look at the heuristically most common reasons for low school performance: percentage of economically disadvantaged students, student demographics, and school funding to see if these indicators are statistically different in low performing schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remove the factors outside of the school adminsitration's control from the dataset to determine which school-level factors are most important in determining low performance by:\n",
    "    1. Performing Feature Importance using XGBoost. XGBoost is a tree-based gradient-boosting method which minimizes a cost function relative to predicting a target variable. When a node in a decision tree is split, we can calculate the following reduction in impurity, and attribute this reduction to feature involved. When the tree is finished splitting nodes, those features with the largest proportional contribution toward decreasing impurity within nodes can be said to be the most “important.”\n",
    "    2. Targeting schools that deviate between low performance and non-low performance. For each year, we isolate which schools either became low performing or non-low performing from the previous year. We rank the percent change in each feature, and deem those with the highest change of percentage year to year as potentially influential. \n",
    "    3. Finally, reviewing the covariance ranking of our selected features to determine which features likely interact in a parametric model. \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Test the predictive nature of our selected features by creating a classification model to predict whether or not a school is low performing for each of our 4 years. Whether these features are important will be reflected in the accuracy and precision of the classification model. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use a new methodology for decision-making. We create a function that will synthesize data based on percent changes in a certain input feature to then be used in our classification model to predict low performance. This will allow us to review, all things being equal, how a change in one or more features may correlate to a change in school performance. \n",
